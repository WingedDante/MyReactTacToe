This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Example React Tic Tac Toe Application
## Goal
Take the normal react starter tutorial and add all the pieces that would turn it into a more real world scenario,
where a small app is created that's extendable.  Also included are testing and documentation.  

# Run Application
1. Clone Repo
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn start`
# Run Tests
1. After running `yarn` to generate node_modules and pull in dependencies, run `yarn test` to start the test runner.
# Test Coverage
1. After running `yarn` to generate node_modules and pull in dependencies, run `yarn test --coverage` to start the test runner. Tests coverage docs will be generated in \coverage\ . You can view the report in your browser by opening \coverage\lcov-report\index.html.
